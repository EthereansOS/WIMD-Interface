## Rules

Where Is My Dragon is a card-crafting game. Your objective is to acquire one of the 8 Unicorn Dragon cards. These entitle you to a portion of the treasury.

Every 6300 ETH blocks—approximately once a day—the treasury increases via DFOhub’s fair inflation. You can read more about the fair inflation <a href="https://dfohub.com">here</a>

### Cards

There are 7 types.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-u-i-d-l/Where-Is-My-Dragon/main/assets/img/cards.png"></img>

Four are COMMON (green). 

Common cards can be farmed by adding liquidity to the Uniswap pairs "buidl-ETH", "arte-ETH" and "UniFi-ETH". You can also buy them on the market:

They can also be bought on the market (if someone acquires and sells one)

## Crafting

All crafting formulas require different amounts of the three card types.

The exact amount and types of cards required to craft is a secret!


### The Unicorn Dragon is the most difficult to craft. Let me give you some hints on how it can be done…

1 - There are six methods. 


2 - Once one method is used, it’s impossible to use again. 


3 - Think about the transaction... you have to reach the right block.

## Rare and Legendary cards

Not all cards are craftable. 10 rare cards—5 Penguin Unicorns and 5 Unicorn Ghosts—and 2 legendary Unicorn Dragons are being inflated fractionally into circulation over one year by the DFOhub and NERV wallets.

## The Fragmented Dragons

There may be 8 Unicorn Dragons in total, but Uniswap and other AMMs lock a tiny portion of tokens when you create a pair. Thus, the two dragons mentioned above will never be fully inflated into circulation. This means that to complete the seventh, part of the eighth will have to be acquired, and so the eight will never be whole, and nobody will be able to redeem its share of treasure.

#### This is why all of the calculations are based on 7 existing dragons. 

## UniSwap Card Trading Links
We forked the Uniswap Front-End fork to automatically list the cards (without making any core changes). You can find it here: https://github.com/b-u-i-d-l/WIMD-uniswap.
